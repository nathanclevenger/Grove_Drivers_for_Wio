//DESCRIPTION       "Grove - Servo is DC motor with gearing and feedback system. It is used in driving mechanism of robots. The module is a bonus product for Grove lovers. We regulated the three-wire servo into a Grove standard connector. You can plug and play it as a typical Grove module now, without jumper wires clutter. But if you feel more like a proto servo, check out EMAX 9g ES08A High Sensitive Mini Servo. They are the same model, both of good quality and burden-free price."
